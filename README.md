Using backendless for the server, currently deploying to duthie-dg.surge.sh. A lot of stuff is hard-coded at the moment, but is sort of set up to be configurable, probably at build time, then we'll deploy multiple websites and optimize SEO for each.

Deploy to something that can serve the index on any path. Netlify? AWS? Name it "roller.io"

Add ads using one of these: https://bloggingwizard.com/best-google-adsense-alternatives/

Alternatively, use affiliate links with Amazon, https://infinitediscs.com/Affiliate-Program, or http://hyzerflip.com/affiliate/login. If all we have is links, write out ~30 fun blurbs that people will actually read. Don't include ads in all of them.
