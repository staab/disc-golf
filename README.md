Using Backendless for the server, currently deploying to Netlify, using Google domains for the domain (anhyzer.io).

A lot of stuff is hard-coded at the moment, but is sort of set up to be configurable, probably at build time, then we'll deploy multiple websites and optimize SEO for each. Some suggested SEO stuff might be open graph (https://ogp.me/) and schema.org https://schema.org/docs/gs.html

Add ads using one of these: https://bloggingwizard.com/best-google-adsense-alternatives/

Alternatively, use affiliate links with Amazon, https://infinitediscs.com/Affiliate-Program, or http://hyzerflip.com/affiliate/login. If all we have is links, write out ~30 fun blurbs that people will actually read. Don't include ads in all of them.
