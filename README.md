Using Backendless for the server, currently deploying to Heroku, using Google domains for the domain (anhyzer.io).

A lot of stuff is hard-coded at the moment, but is sort of set up to be configurable, probably at build time, then we'll deploy multiple websites and optimize SEO for each. Some suggested SEO stuff might be open graph (https://ogp.me/) and schema.org https://schema.org/docs/gs.html

Add ads using one of these: https://bloggingwizard.com/best-google-adsense-alternatives/

Alternatively, use affiliate links with Amazon, https://infinitediscs.com/Affiliate-Program, or http://hyzerflip.com/affiliate/login. If all we have is links, write out ~30 fun blurbs that people will actually read. Don't include ads in all of them.

# Todo

[x] Add page to view past score sheets/games
[x] Handle errors when submitting scores, show empty results when retrieving stuff
[x] Add directory
[x] Intercept and cache scoreboard via sw when offline
[ ] Fix touch targets on ios
[ ] Handle online/offline events and give folks hints that it's ok to submit scores when offline
